# make sure to use primary, secondary, tertiary etc (daisyui standard colors) for each and every single thing you want to color - I want to be able to implement themes later

## Routes

- **/** interva timer
- **/themes** options to switch between daisyUI themes for the app
- **/about** page about the project and me (include a buy me a coffee link)
- **/settings** -> page for changing timer settings + other optional stuff

# do things side by side (e.g one page a time, frontend first then functionality etc), don't focus on only one thing
