# Interva

I've¬†built¬†this¬†project¬†as¬†a¬†modern,¬†customizable¬†Pomodoro¬†timer¬†application that¬†can¬†help¬†anyone¬†stay¬†focused¬†and¬†maintain¬†a¬†healthy¬†work-study¬†rhythm¬†with¬†its¬†sleek¬†interface.

Originally,¬†this¬†project¬†was¬†only¬†going¬†to¬†be¬†added¬†to¬†my¬†portfolio¬†for¬†recruiters. However, after finishing the app, I decided to keep¬†it¬†open¬†source¬†and¬†available¬†for anyone to download.
Whether¬†you're¬†a¬†student¬†who¬†has¬†trouble¬†focusing¬†on¬†their¬†work,¬†a¬†recruiter¬†who's¬†looking¬†for¬†hirees¬†or¬†you¬†just¬†want¬†to¬†test¬†this¬†app¬†out¬†and¬†contribute¬†to¬†it,¬†this¬†is¬†the¬†place¬†for¬†you¬†:)

### Disclaimer: Interva is still in early development! Expect to see bugs and potential performance issues.

## FAQ

---

### Is it a virus?

No. The app is fully open-source. You can check the code yourself if you don't take my word for it.

---

### Why does my computer flag the app as a virus then?

I need a code signing certificate for Windows and macOS, which costs money. :(

---

### My browser flags the `.msi` file as a virus and doesn't let me download it, what should I do?

Try disabling some security settings in your browser (e.g., Safe Browsing in Chrome). If that doesn't work, you can also try turning off real-time protection in your antivirus temporarily.

---

### Windows Defender warns me about the app being a potential threat and won't let me run it. How do I bypass this?

Click on "More info" and then on "Run anyway."

---

### macOS says that the app is corrupted and can't be opened. How can I get around this?

Run the following command to install the app:

```bash
sudo xattr -rd com.apple.quarantine "/Users/(your username)/Downloads/interva_1.2.0_aarch64.dmg"
```

Replace `(your username)` with your actual macOS username.

---

### What's the point of this application?

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break work into focused intervals (typically 25 minutes) separated by short breaks. Interva takes this concept and adds:

## Cozy design:

- Distraction-Free Interface: A clean, minimal design that stays out of your way
- Customization: Adjust focus time, break durations, and number of rounds to match your workflow
- Visual Comfort: Choose from 35+ beautiful themes to match your setup or mood
- Audio Cues: Gentle sound effects to signal transitions without being disruptive

## Smart Features:

- Auto-start next sessions (configurable)
- Optional ticking sound for ambient focus
- Long break rewards after completing your rounds
- Volume control for all sound effects

---

### Will it be available on Android and iOS?

Not in the near future, and unlikely if the app ends up in the Github repository graveyard.

---

### Will it be available on app stores?

No. It costs money. I don't have dabloons to spare. (although it might happen if you donate on my Ko-Fi :D)

## ‚òï Supporting my work

Projects like these take a lot of time to make, and I don't make anything from them.
I have a big dream of creating my own startup to help students study more efficiently - your contribution would be heart-melting to me. ‚ù§Ô∏è
